# Vala Sublime Text Plugin

## Goals

- [ ] Improved syntax highlighting with the latest language changes, using sublime-syntax definitions
- [ ] Updated code snippets
- [ ] Include a Lazy build system that uses [`valac`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Tutorial#Compile_and_Run) to build a program using all the `.vala` files the current directory and subdirectories, to a `build/` folder
	- [ ] A "default lazy Compile to C" Build option
	- [ ] Have custom build settings that allow compiler args to be configured like packages to include, compile methods etc.
